        Search Google News for adverse media coverage related to a specific subject.
        
        This endpoint searches for news articles that contain both the search subject and adverse keywords,

        - Reputational risk assessment
        - Due diligence screening
        - Compliance monitoring
        - Background checks
        
        **Relevance Scoring:**
        - Articles are scored 0-100% based on subject match and adverse keyword presence
        - Only articles with 15%+ relevance are returned
        - Results are sorted by relevance score (highest first)
